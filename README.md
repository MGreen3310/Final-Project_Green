Hello! If you are looking to run this project, you can just go ahead and execute the main.py file.
If you are looking to use this project as a stepping stone in your project, I would recommend starting with the deck.py & dealer.py files. Those are the simplest & easiest to integrate into other styles of poker.

95% of this is my work, with some small changes made by my friends on Discord. Most of their changes were optimizations to run time & how many lines of code I needed.
If there was any error I didn't understand or any section I was stuck on for too long, I would ask for help online. Some error debugging was done using ChatGPT, but mainly to help me with why it was having an error.

My main() function is included in the player_2.py module. If you are curious as to why it's not in main.py, I didn't realize I needed a main() function until Friday lol.

If you are looking to understand how this project developed, I did not want to submit it until I was proud of my work.

For unraveling the metaphorical present, I recommend following this order: deck.py -> dealer.py -> main.py -> logic.py -> intro.py -> player_2.py. This was also the order in which I developed the project.
